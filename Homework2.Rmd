# Problem 1 (30 points)

During class you completed an activity in which you practiced `git` commands and operations (such as forking a repository, cloning it using `git clone`, and uploading changes using `git push`).

In this exercise you are asked to modify the `flpoly_student.md` file you worked during class, and format it using the **markdown** tools discussed in class. You must **create a table** that shows the courses you are currently enrolled in, using for the headers of the table: 

- Prefix: in bold letters (such as **COP**)
- Number: in bold letters (such as **2073**)
- Name: in italics (such as _Introduction to Data Science_)
- Credits (such as 3)

a. Make sure your GitHub repo (`practice-repo/`) shows the results of your updated file (remember to use the commands `git add .` , `git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE"`, and `git push`) 

b. Include a link to your GitHub repo in this document.

[Kristopher Ratz Repo](https://github.com/kristopherratz/practice-repo)
  
c. Take a screenshot of the GitHub repo, add the screenshot file to the repo, and include it in this document (review how to insert a picture using markdown)

# Problem 2 (30 points)

For this problem, you are asked to create a list of **3 concepts** you have learned about so far this semester. Include the name of the course as a sub-heading (that is, using `##`), and the concepts as an unordered list. Include a link to information about at least one of the concept you listed (for example a link to the Wikipedia page about that concept/topics).

_Edit this `.Rmd` file to include the solutions here._

```{r}
Concepts <- list(
  ##Intro to Data Science
  Concept_1 = "Markdown Syntax",
  Concept_2 = "Working with R Studio",
  Concept_3 = list(
    Topic = "R studio Packages",
    Link = "https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/"
  )
)
```


# Problem 3 (40 points)

In this problem you will practice some basic R operations. Include solutions to each items by inserting a new R chunk of code (make sure you run the chunk so that the output is displayed)

(a) Create a variable called `my_name` that contains your preferred name.
```{r}
my_name <- "Kristopher Ratz"
print(my_name)
```

(b) Create a variable called `name_length` that holds how many letters are in `my_name`.
```{r}
name_length <- nchar(my_name) - 1
print(name_length)
#Removed One because of the space between First and Last Name
```

(c) Show which value is bigger: $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$. 
```{r}
exp(1)^pi > pi^exp(1)
print(exp(1)^pi)
print((pi)^exp(1))
#e^pi is indeed greater than pi^e
```


(d) Define a function called `add_three` that takes a single argument and returns a value with 3 units added to the original input.
```{r}
add_three <- function(argument){
  value <- argument + 3
}

print(add_three(5))
```


(e) Use the colon operator `:` to create a vector `v` of numbers from 10 to 49. Find the length of this vector using the `length()` function.
```{r}
numbers_range <- 10:49
length(numbers_range)
```

(f) Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of number from -5 to 10 in 0.5 increments.

```{r}
half_counting <- seq(-5,10,0.5)
print(half_counting)
```
